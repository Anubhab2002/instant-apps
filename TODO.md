- Create ESLint so that package name is same as `apps/<folder-name>`.
- Sandbox uses react-scripts which has its own version of webpack and babel-loader. Conflicts with felvin-cli. Make sure to create a minimal react app for a sandbox and delete sandbox in the root.
- See if root dist-types can be used to publish types in packages.
- add a serve command to felvin-cli using webpack dev server
